# Make Railway Service Public and Get URL

Your service is set to "Private" - we need to make it public to get a URL.

## Steps to Make it Public:

### Option 1: In Service Settings
1. Click on the **"web"** service card
2. Click **"Settings"** button
3. Look for **"Visibility"** or **"Public"** setting
4. Change it from **"Private"** to **"Public"**
5. Save the changes

### Option 2: Generate Domain (Makes it Public)
1. Click on the **"web"** service card
2. Look for **"Domains"** tab or section
3. Click **"Generate Domain"** or **"Add Domain"**
4. This will automatically make it public and create a URL

### Option 3: Service Overview
1. Click on **"web"** service
2. In the service page, look for a toggle or setting for **"Public"**
3. Enable it
4. Then click **"Generate Domain"**

## After Making it Public:

Once public, Railway will:
- Generate a public URL automatically
- Or you can click "Generate Domain" to create one

The URL will look like:
```
https://soundflakes-production-xxxx.up.railway.app
```

## Quick Steps:

1. **Click "web" service** → **Settings**
2. **Find "Visibility"** → Change to **"Public"**
3. **Go to "Domains"** → Click **"Generate Domain"**
4. **Copy the URL**

**Note:** Making it public allows anyone with the URL to access your app. For a master-slave audio app, this is usually fine since you control who gets the URL.
